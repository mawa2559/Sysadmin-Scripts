# Sysadmin-Scripts
This is a collection of PowerShell, GAM and other scripts that I've created to make my life as a Sysadmin and System Engineer easier. Many were built with a specific purpose in mind but are easily customizable for a variety of use cases.  
WARNING: There is no guarantee that these scripts are thoroughly tested and use could have adverse affects on production evironments. Use at your own risk.

# GAM (GAMADV-XTD3)
An extension of "regular" GAM, this command line tool is a Google Workspace Admin's best friend. It has a huge community of users and excellent documentation.

# Okta
Okta has a robust API that you can interact with via REST calls or their offical PowerShell Module. In addition, one of the most valuable tools for any Okta admin is the rockstar Chrome extension which introduces advanced functionality to the Admin Portal UI such as... csv exports. See the resources below for related information.
