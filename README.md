# Sysadmin-Scripts

This is a collection of PowerShell, GAM and other scripts that I've created to make my life as a Sysadmin and System Engineer easier. Many were built with a specific purpose in mind but are easily customizable for a variety of use cases.

WARNING: There is no guarantee that these scripts are thoroughly tested and use could have adverse affects on production evironments. Use at your own risk.
