#This Script uses Okta's official PowerShell Module integration and requires set up/authorization prior to running
#For instructions on setting up the Module, please refer to https://developer.okta.com/blog/2024/05/07/okta-powershell-module

#This script takes a CSV that contains two columnsï»¿; one column GroupName contains the desired name for our Okta groups, second column CostCenterID contains the cost center ID corresponding to membership for that group
#The CostCenterID is referenced as the criteria for dynamic Okta group membership via the Group Rule - for each group, if a user has the associated CostCenterID in their Okta profile, they will be added to the group
#Great for creating relatively simple groups and group rules where membership is determined by simple criteria, but can be expanded easily.
